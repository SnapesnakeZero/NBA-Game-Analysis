## Draft Analysis Conclusion
1. There were tendencies in recent time that NBA teams prefered player that had lower height and weight when they pick player in draft. From what I gather trought the internet, this tendency happened because NBA games tends to moves towards to small ball game that required agile and fast paced play. Players that had big posture tends to have shortage in speed and agility, this makes NBA teams not prefer this type of player
2. NBA teams prefer to pick young player, the reason is young player tend to have more potential than the old players
3. On average, the older the player first drafted to NBA, they tend to have higher weight and lower height.
4. Over years NBA teams has strength it's interest to foreign players. It was shown by the increase of player drafted that originated outside of USA
5. NBA teams tends to pick player that already join the college than player who participated the NBA when they gradulated from high school. I think the reason of this trend is player who join from college tends to have more experience throught the NCAA league
## NBA Games Analysis Conclusion
1. NBA teams seeking agile and fast player, this was shown by the downturn of average height and weight of player through years. This was also align with the visualization before that show NBA teams preference when they drafted player
2. NBA become more young, this was shown from the downturn of average age through years
3. Majority of player that played in NBA is the player who being pick in the first round pick
4. In recent time NBA teams open more opportunity to player that was undrafted to play in NBA, this can be seen from the increase number of undrafted players played in NBA.
5. Player with higher draft number tend to contribute more to the teams. This means that draft number is still important to the teams because player who being pick with higher draft number tends to contribute more for the teams
## Player Analysis Conclusion
1. The greater the number of matches that the player participates in, the higher the average net rating of the player during his career in the NBA. This shows that NBA teams can still rely on veteran player to give positive contribution to the teams
2. Over years, there were increase in total point, rebound, and assist in single season. This was cause by small ball game that demanded faster pace of play, faster pace of play tends to generated more point, rebound, and assist because it was easier to get them
## Conclusion
1. Player had higher average point, rebound, and assist in recent years because the increase importance of the small ball game
2. There were change in NBA teams preference from big man era (1990's - 2000's) to small ball era (2010's - now), the changes make NBA teams tend to seek player who had smaller stature (lower height and weight)
3. It's seems that NBA internationalization that started from david stern era was successful, this was shown from more player originated outside of USA
